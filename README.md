## Development

    git clone git@github.com:ZniehGames/znieh.git
    git submodule update --init

It's recommended that you use the provided [vagrant](https://github.com/ZniehGames/znieh-vagrant) environment.

Inside the VM (`vagrant ssh` and`cd /var/www/znieh`), run the following commands:

* `composer install` for symfony deps
* `npm install` for gulp and Node.js deps
* `bower install` for frontend deps
* `gulp`  to build
* `gulp watch`  to build & rebuild on changes

If you are experiencing issues with npm (EEXIST errors) see also the README of [vagrant](https://github.com/ZniehGames/znieh-vagrant)
* `npm install --no-bin-links`

## Using in production

You must generate your own SSH keys for JWT Authentification

    openssl genrsa -out app/var/jwt/private.pem -aes256 4096
    openssl rsa -pubout -in app/var/jwt/private.pem -out app/var/jwt/public.pem

Then modify SSH keys path and the pass phrase in app/config/parameters.yml according to your needs.
